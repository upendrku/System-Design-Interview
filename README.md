## OBJECTIVE
1. How to identify the right tech stack?
2. When to use a state management system?
3. How to represent an in-depth block diagram ?
4. How to represent complete HLD / LLD ?
5. How to create a sequence diagram?
6. Consideration aspects for the use case.
7. Leveraging generic templating mechanism.
8. Component-based architecture design.
9. Connection to downstream services.
10. Instrumentation, tracking & logging

## DIAGRAMS
    > HLD (High Level Design)
    > LLD (Low Level Design)
    > Sequence

## Sample Question -
Design the frontend of a cryptocurrency exchange orderbook with buy and sell bitcoin
as the options to the trader.

## Interviewer's Expectations
1. Create a block diagram for the question given.
2. Ability to choose one tech stack over another.
3. Create API schema for backend communication.
4. Ability to identify the edge scenarios.
5. Ability to identify components in the UI.
6. Write pseudo code for potential imolementation.
7. Explain the approach along the way.
8. Confidence in the approach chosen.
9. Take account of testing, code quality & maintainability.
10. How are you deploying the frontend components

## HLD (High Level Design)
1. Signifies the overall system.
2. States concise functionality of each component.
3. Also called macro-level design.
4. Developed by Solution Architect.
5. HLD is created before the LLD.
6. Converts requirements into solution.
7. Necessary to understand the system.

## Considerations while creating UI components
1. Accessibility
2. Design consistency
3. Theming ability
4. Reusability
5. Customisability
6. Extendability

## Server side rendering
1. Faster page load
2. Better SEO
3. Increases complexity

## client side rendering
1. Modular architecture
2. Less complex
3. Low Response payload

## LLD (Low Level Design)
1. Describes the components of HD
2. States the logic of the components used.
3. Also called micro-level design
4. Developed by software developers.
5. Developed after HLD is completed.
6. Changes HLD into comprehensive solution.
7. Describes configurations & trouble shooters.

## LLD Sequence
1. Tech stack - What? Why?
2. Components - Name and identify the components
3. Data structure - Define API Schema
4. Pseudo code

## Before choosing frontend frameworks
1. Popularity - Community support
2. Core features
3. Flexibility
4. Ease of integration
5. 55R support
6. Mobile support
7. Commu nity
8. Future support
9. Market Adoption
