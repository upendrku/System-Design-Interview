## Component based UI design
The reason why component based design is becoming this popular is because of the advancements made by Facebook and showing that scale can be achieved with this approach.

This micro architecture has a different deployment cycle. It makes sense if each component has a different build all together.

If it is an API level in the components, definitely breaking it down into multiple projects has been one of the keys of most of the big companies to achieve a lot.

And you will figure out how important these components are. So each component can be loaded individually, we don't want all the components to be loaded in one shot because that is going to hamper the load times of the website. So definitely you would be loading only core components and other components can load on the fly.

## Performance and Scale
So companies like Google, Facebook or Flipkart, Walmart, all these companies scale is everything, because if something goes down, it is millions of dollars get lost. So your system should be performing well in scale. Quality should be assured in scale and in in the development skill. It should scale to multiple teams.
